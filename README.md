# CPU-Scheduler


Written in C, this program will take an input file of the form:

processcount 2        # Read 5 processes
runfor 15             # Run for 15 time units
use rr                # Can be fcfs, sjf, or rr
quantum 2             # Time quantum â€“ only if using rr
process name P1 arrival 3 burst 5
process name P2 arrival 0 burst 9
end

And perform either First-Come First-Served, preemptive Shortest Job First, or
Round-Robin CPU scheduling algorithms. 

An example output is below:

2 processes
Using Round-Robin
Quantum 2

Time 0: P2 arrived
Time 0: P2 selected (burst 9)
Time 2: P2 selected (burst 7)
Time 3: P1 arrived
Time 4: P1 selected (burst 5)
Time 6: P2 selected (burst 5)
Time 8: P1 selected (burst 3)
Time 10: P2 selected (burst 3)
Time 12: P1 selected (burst 1)
Time 13: P1 finished
Time 13: P2 selected (burst 1)
Time 14: P2 finished
Time 14: Idle
Finished at time 15

P1 wait 5 turnaround 10
P2 wait 5 turnaround 14
